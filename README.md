R Interface to Zenodo REST API

## How to

* Install and Load ``zen4R``

```r
require(devtools)
install_github("eblondel/zen4R")
require(zen4R)
```

* Connect to Zenodo

```r
zenodo <- ZenodoManager$new(token = <your_token>, logger = "DEBUG")
```

* Create an empty Zenodo record on Zenodo deposit

```r
myrec <- zenodo$createEmptyRecord()
```

* Fill my record

```r
myrec$setTitle("My publication title")
myrec$setDescription("A description of my publication")
myrec$setUploadType("publication")
myrec$setPublicationType("article")
myrec$addCreator(firstname = "John", lastname = "Doe", affiliation = "Independent")
myrec$setLicense("mit")
myrec$addCommunity("ecfunded")
myrec$setKeywords(c("R","package","software"))
```

* Update my record on Zenodo deposit

```r
myrec <- zenodo$depositRecord(myrec)
```

There is no need to create an empty record with the function ``$createEmptyRecord()``
first on Zenodo and then fill it. You can create a record with ``ZenodoRecord$new()``,
fill it and then deposit it directly using the function ``$depositRecord(record)``.

In order to apply methods to upload a file or delete a record, you need to get the result of the function ``depositRecord`` (see example above) since after the deposition Zenodo returns the record that contains now an internal ``id`` required to identify and apply further actions. This id can be inspected with ``myrec$id``.

Instead, if you don't get the output of ``depositRecord`` and try to upload files or publish the record based on the the local record you handle (built upon ``ZenodoRecord$new()``), this wil not work. Because it is a local record, the ``id`` of the record will still be ``NULL`` and Zenodo will be unable to identify which record on Zenodo needs to be handled.  

* Upload a file

```r
zenodo$uploadFile("path_to_my_file", myrec$id) #upload a file
myrec_files <- zenodo$getFiles(myrec$id) #list files for the deposited record
```

* Publish a deposited record straigh online on Zenodo

Once the deposited record is fine for its publication online on Zenodo, you can publish it:

```r
zenodo$publishRecord(myrec$id)
```

The method ``depositRecord`` handles a shortcut to publish directly the record specifying ``publish = TRUE`` (default is ``FALSE``):

```r
zenodo$depositRecord(myrec, publish = TRUE)
```

This shortcut is to use with cautious, as this will publish straight online your record on Zenodo.
